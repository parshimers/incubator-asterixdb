- multiple tests pointing to same results
- single tests that can be run with different parameters to produce different results
- need clear way to identify which tests are running and not running
- need clear way to run subset of tests
- should keep test metadata (how to run, what results to produce, etc) WITH test, not in separate file
- ideally way of marking "known bugs"
- test fixtures for known/repeated setup (perhaps DON'T want teardown, at least on failures)
- probably keep filename conventions as today (.1.query.aql)
